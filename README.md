# RISC-Processor-Simulator
## Problem Statemnt
Design a CPU including ALUs and Register files, the Control circuitry, Instructions flow etc., on any simulator.

## Project Description
We have designed a 32-Bit RISC inspired Processor with Von Neumann Architecture using Logisim. We have also developed an assembler in python which converts the assembly code into machine language.

## Project Structure

1. Detailed [Report](https://github.com/gagansh7171/RISC-Processor-Simulator/blob/master/Report.pdf) of the project.
2. A [Presentation](https://github.com/gagansh7171/RISC-Processor-Simulator/blob/master/Presentation.pptx) explaining various parts and features of the project.
3. A [Walkthrough](https://github.com/gagansh7171/RISC-Processor-Simulator/blob/master/Walkthrough.mp4) to help understand working of the code.
4. Actual [Project](https://github.com/gagansh7171/RISC-Processor-Simulator/tree/master/RISC-R) here.
5. A [Command line interface](https://github.com/gagansh7171/RISC-Processor-Simulator/blob/master/RISC-R/RISC-R.exe) to interact with the project.
